Hello! I am Brent Wagenseller, and I tend to take detailed notes on things (in order to help me remember how to do them). I recently graduated with a MS in Computer Science (with a concentration in Machine Learning) from [Georgia Tech](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/); while there, I offered my notes to the student body and they seemed to be popular. 

I decided to do something similar here. The following notes are from a combination of notes on my own personal experience, frantic searches on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), technical books I have read (and will reference), and classes I have taken. Please note that these are continuously 'in progress' - as this is both a hobby and a massive undertaking, there will be mistakes / holes / portions that are clearly unfinished.
