## Why I Do This

I find that I have to write things down, in a format I understand, in order for me to fully understand a topic; therefore I take notes on subjects I try to learn. These notes are an artifact of that line of thinking.

## My Note Sources

My main note sources are: 
* Various code examples I have seen on the web.  
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)  
* [Kubernetes in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-kubernetes-in-a-month-of-lunches)  
   * [KIAMOL Exercises](https://github.com/sixeyed/kiamol)  


## Docker is Critical  

You will have to understand Docker (or an equivalent) to use Kubernetes. See [my Docker overview](/operating_systems/docker/).  

## Kubectl is Critical  

You will have to understand Kubectl (or an equivalent tool) to use Kubernetes. See [my Kubectl overview](/operating_systems/kubernetes/kubectl).  

# Terms  

# Pod  

A <font color="green">Pod</font> is similar to a [Docker Container](operating_systems/docker/docker_basics?id=container); If could be a Docker container, or it could be similiar to it but something else. If it is Docker-related it _could_ be a single container, but it could also be a several containers all configured identically.
