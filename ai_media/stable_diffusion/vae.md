# SD - VAEs  

From Brave's Summarizer:  
A Variable Autoencoder (VAE) is a technique used to improve the quality of AI-generated images created with the text-to-image model Stable Diffusion. VAE encodes an image into a latent space, which is a lower-dimensional representation of the image, and then that latent space is decoded into a new, higher quality image. VAEs are part of the neural network model that encode and decode the images to and from the smaller latent space, so that computation can be faster. There are two main types of VAEs that can be used with Stable Diffusion: EMA and MSE. VAEs are available in the older `.vae.pt` and `.ckpt` format as well as the newer, safer, and faster `.safetensors` format. VAEs enhance the vividness of colors and sharpness of images, especially improving the rendering of hands and faces.
