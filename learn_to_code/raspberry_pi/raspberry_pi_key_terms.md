# Raspberry Pi - Key Terms

# Single-board computers

**Single-board computers** is a bare-bones 'computer' - it has a single circut board, RAM a processor, networking, and input/output ports. Hardware cant be upgraded as its integrated on the board itself. These are usually low-cost alternatives to buying expensive servers.

# NOOBS

**NOOBS** (New Out Of Box Software) is an easy to use Rasperry Pi operation installation guide. You can get by without using NOOBS, but this would mean you would have to manually image your microSD card yourself (and this is required if you do not want to use the standard OS, [Raspbian](learn_to_code/raspberry_pi/raspberry_pi_key_terms?id=raspbian).

# Raspbian

**Raspbian** is the official OS for Raspberry Pi. Its certainly possible to install another OS (you can find a list if you scroll down on [this page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/), but Rasbian is the 'official' OS.

Raspbian is a lightweight version of Debian (a flavor of Linux).

Instructions on installing Raspbian can be found [here](learn_to_code/raspberry_pi/raspberry_pi_install?id=installation-of-raspbian).
