# YAML

# Terminology  
  
## Manifest  

YAML files typically have a .yaml extension and are known as a <font color="green">Manifest</font>. They are known as a <font color="green">Manifest</font> because a YAML file _describes_ how something should be built. The definition of 'manifest' is used here, specifically the definition 'a list of passengers or an invoice of cargo for a vehicle (such as a ship or plane)'. Think of the <font color="green">Manifest</font> as a listing of instructions or an invoice of software and settings for a deployment.  

# Nesting  

Nesting is the concept of grouping a section of code - be it via a function, a `FOR` loop, a `WHILE` loop, etc. Usually, nesting is done between brackets (i.e. `{}`), but in YAML, it nests with indentations (much like [Python](learn_to_code/python/)).  It should be noted that spaces are required for the indentation; `TAB` is _not_ acceptable in YAML as indentation.
