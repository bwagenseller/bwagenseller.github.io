# Nesting  

Nesting is the concept of grouping a section of code - be it via a function, a `FOR` loop, a `WHILE` loop, etc. Usually, nesting is done between brackets (i.e. `{}`), but in YAML, it nests with indentations (much like [Python](learn_to_code/python/)).  It should be noted that spaces are required for the indentation; `TAB` is _not_ acceptable in YAML as indentation.
