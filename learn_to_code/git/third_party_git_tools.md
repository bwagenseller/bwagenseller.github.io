# Third Party Git Tools

# Starting a Git Page

You can maintain your own webpage via GitHub! Its nice, as its free and can incorporate [Docsify and markdown](learn_to_code/docsify/). To start your page, follow [these easy instructions](https://pages.github.com/).

Along the way you will have to pick an empty directory (we will call it `MyDirectoryForGithub`) and then:
```
cd MyDirectoryForGithub
git clone https://github.com/bwagenseller/bwagenseller.github.io.git
```

you are now set up!
