# Java Terms and Concepts

# Artifact

A maven **artifact** is typically a [jar file](learn_to_code/java/java_basics?id=jar-files) that contains its associated [class files](learn_to_code/java/java_basics?id=the-class-file). A project's artifact is usually created with maven.

In addition, artifacts are also jar dependencies that Maven loads.

# Headless

For java to be **headless** means there is no associated GUI with the application; it simply runs from the command line.
