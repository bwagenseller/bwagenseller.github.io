# Programming Concepts

# Functions / Methods

Functions are blocks of code that can be called from other parts of the code to perform a specific function.

## Methods vs. Functions

Methods are similar to functions, with the only difference being methods are functions that are contained in an Object / Class; functions are stand-alone and not technically contained in classes.
